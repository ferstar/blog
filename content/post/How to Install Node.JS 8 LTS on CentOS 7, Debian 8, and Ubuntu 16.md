## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

## What is NPM?

NPM, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects. second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with the said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. Plenty of Node.js libraries and applications are published on NPM, and much more are added every day.

We are assuming that you have root permission, otherwise, you may start commands with “sudo”.
